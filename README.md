# ALBO-VQE
This repository contains the code and examples for the corresponding paper entitled *Foldager, Jonathan, et al. "Algorithmic agency can improve quantum machine learning"* currently in review.

We combine active learning and bayesian optimization (ALBO) to perform algorithmic agency for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The aim is to do hyperparameter transfer learning in variational quantum circuits.
